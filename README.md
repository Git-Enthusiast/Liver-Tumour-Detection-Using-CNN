# Liver Tumors Segmentation-CNNs
This project segments tumors in the Liver using 2 cascaded CNNs. We use [3D-IRCADb 01](https://www.ircad.fr/research/3d-ircadb-01/) as our dataset.
View the [Thesis](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EorGrTfvjoZNa_utgOUg-yY1JFOVeiHt?usp=drive_link) for more details about the model, dataset, methodology and results.


There are 3 notebooks in this project

* 3d-ircadb-01_util.ipynb
Responsible for renaming files, merging masks and augmenting the dataset

* liver_CNN.ipynb
The first CNN, it uses a CNN to segment the Liver and extract the ROI

* tumor_CNN_final.ipynb
The second CNN, it segments the tumors using a CNN after masking other organs using the extracted ROI from the first CNN

There is the models directories which contains the trained models
* liver_model_final_resunet.h5 which is the first CNN trained for 20 epochs
* tumor_weights_final_50epochs.h5	which is the second CNN trained for 50 epochs
* tumor_weights_final_100epochs.h5 which is the second CNN trained for 100 epochs

### Dependencies ###
I used Anaconda for package management but pip will work all the same

* Tensorflow-GPU
* Keras (Tensorflow) already comes with Tensorflow
* Numpy
* OpenCV
* Matplotlib
* Pydicom
* Jupyter Notebook
* Scipy
* Scikit-learn
* PIL
* Seaborn
* Imageio

### Dataset Structure ###
The structure of the dataset should be as follows ( if you don't want to change the code :grinning: )
```
train
|_ patients               # Contains all the CT-slices from all patients together with no directories inside
|_ masks                  # Contains the masks for the Liver and Tumors for the patients
   |_ merged_livertumors  # Contains the masks of tumors after merging each slice's tumor masks together
   |_ 1.1_liver           # Contains the mask for the liver of each slice for patient 1
   |_ 1.2_liver           # Contains the mask for the liver of each slice for patient 2
   |_ 1.3_liver           # Contains the mask for the liver of each slice for patient 3
      .
      .
      .
   |_ 1.20_liver          # Contains the mask for the liver of each slice for patient 20
```
